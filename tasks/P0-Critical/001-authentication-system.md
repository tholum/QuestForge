## User Stories

### US-001.1: User Registration
```
As a new user
I want to create an account with email and password
So that I can start tracking my goals
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter email, password, and confirm password
- Email validation prevents duplicate registrations
- Password meets strength requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
- Success creates user record and logs them in
- Validation errors are clearly displayed

### US-001.2: User Login
```
As a returning user
I want to log in with my credentials
So that I can access my personal goal data
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter email/username and password
- Correct credentials log user in and redirect to dashboard
- Invalid credentials show appropriate error message
- "Remember me" option extends session duration
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

### US-001.3: Session Management
```
As a logged-in user
I want my session to persist across browser sessions
So that I don't have to log in constantly
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sessions persist for 7 days with "remember me"
- Sessions expire after 24 hours without "remember me"
- Session automatically refreshes during active use
- Logout clears all session data
- Multiple device sessions are supported

### US-001.4: Password Reset
```
As a user who forgot their password
I want to reset it via email
So that I can regain access to my account
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can request password reset with email
- Reset email contains secure, time-limited token
- Reset form validates new password strength
- Old password is invalidated after successful reset
- Process works within 15 minutes of request

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
```
Authentication Flow:
1. User submits credentials → 2. Server validation → 3. JWT/Session creation
4. Set secure cookies → 5. Redirect to dashboard → 6. Middleware protects routes
```

### Database Changes
```sql
-- User table already exists, may need additional fields:
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN emailVerified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN passwordResetToken TEXT;
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN passwordResetExpires DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN lastLoginAt DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN loginAttempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN lockedUntil DATETIME;
```

### Key Components to Implement

#### 1. Authentication API Routes
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion

#### 2. Middleware
- `authMiddleware.ts` - Protect API routes
- `withAuth.tsx` - Protect React components/pages
- `rateLimitMiddleware.ts` - Rate limiting

#### 3. UI Components
- `LoginForm.tsx` - Login form with validation
- `RegisterForm.tsx` - Registration form
- `PasswordResetForm.tsx` - Password reset request
- `ResetPasswordForm.tsx` - New password form
- `AuthLayout.tsx` - Shared auth page layout

#### 4. Utilities
- `auth.ts` - Core authentication functions
- `password.ts` - Password hashing/validation
- `validation.ts` - Input validation schemas
- `security.ts` - Security utilities (CSRF, rate limiting)

### Security Considerations

#### Password Security
- Use bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12
- Minimum password requirements: 8 chars, mixed case, numbers
- Password history to prevent reuse (store hashed)
- Secure password reset tokens (crypto.randomBytes)

#### Session Security
- HttpOnly cookies for session tokens
- SameSite=Strict for CSRF protection
- Secure=true in production (HTTPS only)
- Session rotation after login
- Absolute and idle timeouts

#### API Security
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- CORS configuration for client domains
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma handles this)
- NoSQL injection prevention

## Mobile Considerations

### Touch-Friendly Forms
- Minimum 44px touch targets for buttons
- Large, easy-to-tap form inputs
- Clear visual feedback for form states
- Simplified navigation flow

### Performance
- Lazy load authentication components
- Optimize form validation to reduce re-renders
- Cache authentication state efficiently
- Minimize bundle size impact

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Authentication', () => {
  describe('password validation', () => {
    it('should reject weak passwords', () => {
      expect(validatePassword('123')).toBe(false);
    });
  });
  
  describe('user registration', () => {
    it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
      const user = await registerUser(validUserData);
      expect(user.id).toBeDefined();
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Complete registration flow
- Login/logout flow
- Password reset flow
- Session expiration handling
- Protected route access

### Security Tests
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS prevention
- CSRF token validation
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Session hijacking prevention

## ADHD-Friendly Features

### Visual Design
- Clear, high-contrast form labels
- Immediate validation feedback
- Progress indicators for multi-step flows
- Consistent button placement and styling

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- Single-page forms when possible
- Clear error messages with suggested fixes
- Auto-focus on appropriate fields
- Remember form data on errors

### Engagement
- Success animations after registration
- Welcome messages for new users
- Quick login options for returning users

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Core Setup (3 SP)
- [ ] Choose authentication strategy (NextAuth vs custom)
- [ ] Set up basic auth API routes
- [ ] Implement password hashing utilities
- [ ] Create basic login/register forms

### Week 2: Security & Polish (3 SP)
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and security headers
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Create protected route middleware

### Week 3: Testing & Documentation (2 SP)
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Add Storybook stories for auth components
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation and code review

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Session security**: Improper session handling could lead to security vulnerabilities
- **Password storage**: Incorrect hashing could compromise user data
- **Rate limiting**: Without proper limits, system is vulnerable to brute force

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use established libraries (NextAuth, bcrypt) instead of custom implementation
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement comprehensive testing including security tests
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- 100% of authentication flows work correctly
- 0 security vulnerabilities in penetration testing
- < 3 second authentication response time
- 99.9% uptime for auth services

### User Experience Metrics
- Registration completion rate > 90%
- Login success rate > 95%
- User satisfaction with auth flow > 4.0/5.0
- Accessibility score 95+ (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Notes

### Technical Decisions Needed
- NextAuth.js vs custom JWT implementation
- Session storage (JWT vs database sessions)
- Email service provider for password resets
- Two-factor authentication future support

### Integration Points
- User model already exists in Prisma schema
- Layout components ready for auth pages
- Base components available for forms
- Testing infrastructure in place
